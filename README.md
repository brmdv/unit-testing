# Unit testing challenge

This is an exercise for **unit testing** in Python. 
Simple `assert` expressions are used, as well as the `unittest` and the `pytest` modules.

A basic script is provided by the instructors, on which the tests are implemented. 
The unaltered script can be found in _original.py_. 

Full instructions can be read [here](https://github.com/becodeorg/ANT-Theano-2-27/blob/main/2.python/2.python_advanced/11.unittest/03.challenge.ipynb).
